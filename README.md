Digital Product Management Web Form Assignment

Description of the Project:
Create a survey using 5 html files that ask about the Business Analytics Students about themselves and opinions on the program. The survey goal is to collect and record the information through the web design.


Best Practice:
In designing the web form, I incorporated several best practices to ensure its usability and effectiveness. Firstly, the form layout follows a logical structure, with related fields grouped together and presented in a clear and organized manner. For example questions about the class and questions about the person are separate pages making it easy for users to understand the purpose of each section.

Secondly, each form field is accompanied by descriptive labels or placeholders, providing users with clear guidance on the type of information expected. Descriptive placeholders help users understand the format of the input expected, while labels provide explicit instructions for each field. This practice helps prevent student confusion and reduces the likelihood of input errors.

Overall, these best practices contribute to a positive user experience by making the form intuitive, easy to use, and error-resistant. By using these principles, the web form maximizes usability and ensures that users can interact with it efficiently and effectively.


User Accessibility:
To encourage easy user accessibility, the buttons on the bottom make it easy to navigate to the next page and follow along. The use of the "i" icon gives helpful information to the student as they complete the survey. I also included descripive labels for each question for all fields to make the process as seemless as possible.
